when we interact with another smart contract
eg:-
contract_A

msg.sender

//if  msg.sender  is called from any other smart contract it will use address of that contract neither than address of the sender.
//So we have to use another method tx.origin which will get the address of the account who sent the initial transaction

tx.origin



contract_B

calling contract_A
