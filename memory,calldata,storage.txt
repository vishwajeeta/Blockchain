1.memory :-memory and calldata have some similarity.both are used to store data temparaly
//memory variable can be changed
//struct,mapping,array eg:- string is a array of bites
function addPersion(string memory _name)public{
    _name="cat"; //no error will occur
}

2.calldata:- is temparaly variable that cannot be modified
function addPersion(string memory _name)public{
    _name="cat"; //error will occur "literal can't be converted to string"
}

3.storage:- storage is permanent variable that can be modified
//outside of the function
uint256 myName;//it is implisitly converted to a storage variable
