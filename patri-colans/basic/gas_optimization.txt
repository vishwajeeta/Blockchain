there are few low level code in solidity which can help in gas optimization

Note:- these keywords should only be used for immutable  variables

1.constant
2.immutable

code:-

uint256 public constant MINIMUM_USD= 50 * 1e18;
//21,415 gas  - constant  =   $9.058545
//23,515 gas - non-constant = $9.946845

address public immutable i_owner;
//21,508 gas - immutable
//23,644 gas - non-immutable
